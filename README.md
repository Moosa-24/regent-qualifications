# regent-qualifications
# This website is meant as a showcase of my Regent Qualifications shown through some of my html, css, and javascript skills.

I had made a repository a while ago and was experiencing issues on the github end, 
i used the code from that repository and put it into this one and that's why there
might not be an "exact" starting point for my code according to commits.

There may seem to be many silly commits as well, but to me this is a test website used for trying out different concepts that look presentable, therefore i may make many small commits about 1 thing i add/change when i randomly thought of it (I am currently studying while making this website so it's not my first priority. Feel free to browse through other projects I've attempted on my github)
